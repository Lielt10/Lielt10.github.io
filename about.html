    <p class="pargraph">New Orleans is a Louisiana city on the Mississippi River, near the Gulf of Mexico. Nicknamed the "Big Easy," it's known for its round-the-clock nightlife, vibrant live-music scene and spicy, singular cuisine reflecting its history as a melting pot of French, African and American cultures. Embodying its festive spirit is Mardi Gras, the late-winter carnival famed for raucous costumed parades and street parties. ― Google__

        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">Decatur Street is a street in the French Quarter neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA that runs parallel to the Mississippi River. Decatur was formerly known as "Levee Street" or Rue de la Levée, as it was originally the location of the levee.[1] In 1870, when the river had altered its course, it was renamed "Decatur Street" in honor of the naval hero Stephen Decatur Jr..

            Decatur begins at Canal Street (the corresponding street up-river of Canal Street is Magazine), runs across the French Quarter , and terminates at St. Ferdinand Street in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood. The most famous sights on Decatur Street are Jackson Square and nearby Café du Monde.</p>
